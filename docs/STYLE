if you wish to contribute you must follow these rules :

1. go crazy with comments(not too much), but actual variable names and 
function names should make sense. 

2. only use the provided .clang-format file. 
if you use another formatter replicate the rules.

3. ONLY USE SNAKE CASE. EVERYTHING. (macros go capital snake case)

4. MODULARITY IS STRICT. so for every module (ex window) it only requires its 
dependencies and it doesn't use any external library which doesn't feed in
the purpose of such module

so if you're implementing a renderer module, you might want to use libGL and 
cglm, but don't you ever link with glfw.

this allows for more flexibility so i can switch out window handlers or graphics
libraries without much hassle, also makes project look pretty

5. see project structure, copy project structure 
if you want to make a module lets call it "funny"

"funny" has a meson.build which creates a shared library and overrides any 
already existing dependency with the same name unless it is already used and
is made into a dependency

"funny" is included in root meson.build

"funny" has src and include directories (obviously)

"funny" is in /modules/funny

"funny" exposes it's headers via /modules/funny/include/funny

"funny"'s source file names MUST match the header names.

finally, write your pr title as long as you want it to be but PLEASE don't 
make it too short, attempt to describe whatever the fuck you did 
because i am not reading file changes.

if you want to communicate message me on discord!!

(of course i'm above all rules since this is my own project eat my ass)
(seriously tho feel free to fix the stupid shit i do)
